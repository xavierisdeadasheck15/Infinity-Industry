Hello, and welcome to my WIP Project of Infinidustry, or known as Infinity Industry!

In this mod, i Focus on taking a reference on Infinitode 2, but in mindustry Styles where everything is taken from infinitode 2 while the rest is Mindustry alike

there are Many Sector within a New Planet called Cylistial with a Unique Lore, to see a lore required you to research after beating Boss Sector known as Rusher, Venom, Straggle, Armory, & Aether of End!

This mod also has its own Gameplay like

* Placing Defense on Behind the wall
* Complexity
* Waiting ðŸ—¿
* Bait (Yeah, you can bait)

For now, thats all i can say.

Note:
* There are Level 1 & Level 2 Category right now on the campaign mode
* Everything are still under fixing
* There will be incoming content
* Aether of end is Available only on custom Mode

Plan:
* Make Level 3-5 Category
* Rebalance Endgame stuff for Serpulo & Erekir
* Add More content

If you want to see my progress or ask anything, go to these discord (https://discord.gg/ktBuM9BcEV), for now, See you soon!
